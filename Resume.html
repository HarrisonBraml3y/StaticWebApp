<h1 style="text-align: left; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><u>Introduction</u></h1>
</header>

<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-family: Courier New;">Graduated from Nottingham Trent University with a BSc (Hons) in Games Production. I am most fluent with writing code for Windows software, with a background in game development and have recently begun studying maths in a computer science context, assembling a range of skills for aiding programming skills, as well as practicing problem solving skills through coding challenges under a timed setting. I am analytically focused, creating and assessing as many feedback channels as I can for the most accurate decision making. I’m completely committed and ambitious in regards to my professional career, developing my skills daily.<br><br> </p>

<h1 style="text-align: left; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><u>Skills</U></h1>

</header>
<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-family: Courier New;">
<ul>
<li>Game development - Unreal using C++ / blueprints (node-based scripting), extends to other node-based programming software. Unity engine with C#.  <br><br></li>

<li>Windows software - This has been my main source of concentrated focus, writing Windows application software using C++ inside the Visual Studio IDE. <br><br></li>

<li>Database querying - Experience creating a database from an Excel sheet, then querying that database via a compiled application. <br><br></li>

<li>SQL - Querying databases linked with my own application for extracting, updating and checkin data. <br><br></li>

<li>C++ - Developing Windows software applying my previous game development skills as well as compounding skills daily learning new skills and techniques. <br><br></li>


<li>Troubleshooting computer components in hardware as well as software scenarios. <br><br></li>

<li>Physically capable when in a physically demanding role. <br><br></li>
</ul>

My background begins in game development, which is where I learned the foundations for object oriented programming. I have some experience making back-end systems with game engines especially the Unreal Engine. My work inside Unreal Engine is quite extensive, covering blueprint systems for functioning game loops, different combat mechanics, data structures including data tables, Niagara particles systems, AI pathway and decision-making behaviour, blueprint and C++ debugging. Handling rendering / resource management for optimisation. I also have experience and skills in 3D modelling with 3DS Max. From there and for 3 years now I’ve diverted to software development, where I would work with C++ to create Windows software applications. My IT skills are of a high standard, being familiar with many IT systems and software, Microsoft office, Adobe and other games industry software. I have good organizational skills and cooperation skills. I think that communication is key in team-based environments as it allows for collaboration and efficiency. One of my most fundamental skills I believe is being able to rationally and logically produce a solution for a problem, through planning and scope of a problem. Being able to understand a problem at different scales is a positive skill which enables me to review details of all magnitudes.<br>

<h1 style="text-align: left; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><u>Hobbies</U></h1>
</header>

<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-family: Courier New;">During my free time I enjoy fitness activities such as weightlifting, I feel it is certainly important to combat a non-physical lifestyle with physical test, as well as being physically capable. Go-karting is another hobby I have which forces competition. I have been practicing more mathematics, especially in a computer-science discipline. In my idle time I have found reading non-fiction to be resourceful for supplementing my learning.
