<h1 style="color: black; font-family: Courier New">My experience with various software</h1>

<h1 style="text-align: left; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><u>Operating Systems</u></h1>
<p style="color:grey;">I'm most experienced within Windows, the systems & structure of the operating system is what I'm most familiar with from having spent years using the os. However my preference is Linux due to the speed & navigation. The features & structure of the OS suits my style of minimal visual mess.  </p>


<h1 style="text-align: left; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><u>IDE</u></h1>
<img src="VisualStudio_Logo.png" alt="VS" style="width:50px;height:50px;"><p style="color:grey;">Visual studio is my primary IDE for working with C++ code, along with text editors VS code & recently Vim.<br> I've been using these editors for 3+ years now and have developed my own skill to a level which can support a professional standard of work.<br>I also have some experience using IntelliJ with some Java code<p><br><br>

<img src="Unreal_Engine_Logo.svg.png" alt="UE" style="width:50px;height:50px;">
<h1 style="text-align: left; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><u>Unreal Engine</u></h1>
<p style="color:grey;">Unreal Engine 4 & 5 was what we used in University for the entirety of the 3 year course, this is where I began programming in C++, alongside it's node-based scripting system.<p><br><br>
<img src="Unity_Technologies_logo.svg.png" alt="Unity" style="width:120px;height:50px"><p style="color:grey;">C++ is the language that I learned to write code with, it's also the language I've used the most.<br>From beginning in game development with Unreal Engine, then moving to software development in Windows, I've built a good level of proficiency with the language.<br>I've covered a lot of the fundamentals within the language and programming. <br><br>

<img src="github.svg" alt="Git" style="width:32px;height:18px;" class="GitHub_Logo">
<h1 style="text-align: left; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><u>Git</u></h1>
<p style="color:grey;">I've used Git for 4+ years now, hosting repositories for source control. Frequently using the Git CLI tooling with repositories. I'm very aware of how this platform can be used collaboratively via forking, pull & merge requests.<br><br></p>

<img src="Maya_Logo.png" alt="Maya" style="width:50px;height:50px;">
<h1 style="text-align: left; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><u>3D Modelling</u></h1>
<p style="color:grey;">As part of my University course, 3D modelling was a large sector. I learned Maya & 3DS Max, I used these for developing models for <br>games purposes, then imported them into an engine for development. Becoming familiar with various topology techniques & optimisations. <br>I particularly enjoyed working with and understanding 3D space & kinematics</p>
<br><br>

<h1 style="text-align: left; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><u>Unreal Engine</u></h1>
<p style="color: grey;">My programming work extends to a few different languages, the most commonly used language I have is C++, I've used some C# in Unity scripting, web based stacks including html, JavaScript, Bootstrap. <br>I'm experienced using different libraries. My previous programs have been built using a range of different libraries for UI purposes(ImGui), 2D rendering(glfw3), physics(box2d), database querying(odbc) - some varying ranges of libraries I've used in multiple projects.</p>

<br><br>
<p style="color: grey;"> Software development lifecycle - I've become effective in a lot of areas of software development. QA testing is an aspect that I learned in game development and has been a constant while I'm programming. <br>Debugging is a part of this, running & testing code habitually is a method I use for testing. <br>Optimising for performance is key to development also, monitoring data management, memory & utilising the language tools (pointers, references etc.). </p><br><br>

<h1 style="text-align: left; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><u>Databases</u></h1>
<p style="color: grey;"> Databases - having identified the usefulness of databases in software & programming, I decided I should become familiar with how to operate and manage a database. Using MS Sql Server with the odbc library to query the database from a C++ program.
